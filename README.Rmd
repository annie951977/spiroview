# Description

`spiroview` is an R package that provides the tools to visualize and explore spirometry data in demographic studies. This package is targeted for the healthcare focused researcher who may not have an extensive coding background but wishes to use R for their research study. The `spiroview` package was developed using `R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)`, `Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)`, and `Running under: macOS Big Sur 11.7.4`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of spiroview from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annie951977/spiroview")
```

Overview

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(spiroview)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
